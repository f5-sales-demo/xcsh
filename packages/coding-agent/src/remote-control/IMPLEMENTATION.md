# Native remote interoperability gate — issue 3818

This is an unfinished implementation of the first gate in issue 3818, not a
completed remote voice feature. Do not merge or publish before the acceptance
criteria in that issue are satisfied.

## Source contract

Codex rust-v0.153.4 commit `3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a` is the
compatibility baseline. The port uses the production enrollment, refresh,
pairing, and v3 relay contracts. See NOTICE.md and LICENSE. Test fixtures contain
unmodified upstream initialization, thread-list, configuration, and model-list schemas.

xcsh sends its own name, version, originator, installation identity, and selected
subscription credential. It does not invoke Codex, use Codex enrollment state,
or run another agent against the terminal's session file.

## Implemented for the first gate

- Native subscription selection, enrollment, host credential refresh, and pairing.
- Private Unix socket, background host, opt-in enable/disable/status/pair commands.
- `/remote` status and registration from InteractiveMode only.
- Existing AgentSession attachment, text turns, steering, interruption, visible
  text history, and assistant text events.
- Initialization, thread list/read/resume, loaded list, and unsubscribe.
- Phone bootstrap metadata and existing-terminal queue reads.
- Non-PTY standalone process capture/streaming, stdin, cancellation, and exit events.
- Relay framing, chunking, acknowledgements, replay buffers, and duplicate sequence
  suppression. Request results remain cached in the owning TUI across host reconnect.
- Registration heartbeats, owner collision rejection, and reconnecting TUI bridges.
- Explicit errors for unsupported methods and model/input overrides.

The `codexHome` wire field points to xcsh's remote directory. Its spelling is an
upstream protocol requirement, not a dependency on a Codex installation.

## Validation evidence

Observed failing tests preceded implementation for enrollment, selected auth,
pairing, relay, sessions, IPC, routing, host registration, bridge, CLI, slash
status, credential refresh, and local protocol dispatch.

The live service accepted native xcsh enrollment (1617 ms), pairing, refresh, and
relay connection on 2026-09-09. Two real terminal sessions, using Luna and Astra,
registered with distinct names and session-specific context. These service checks preceded the manual iPhone confirmations below.

Verification completed: 57 focused tests / 161 assertions; workspace lint and
TypeScript checks; affected coding-agent suite (7291 passed, 561 skipped, zero
failures across 727 files); changed-scope PII enforcement and diff whitespace.
A live host restart preserved both TUIs. Native local-protocol prompts returned
each session's distinct marker (2796 ms Luna, 3544 ms Astra), and repeated request
identities did not append another prompt. State/socket permissions verified as
0700 for the directory and 0600 for credentials and the socket.

Manual gate: the user reported successful iPhone pairing and a green connection
indicator. Opening a session initially showed “Error loading messages”. Sanitized
relay diagnostics identified experimental `initialTurnsPage` and live-resume
configuration defaults; these are now supported using the pinned Rust source's
loaded-thread rejoin semantics. The exact phone-shaped resume request passed
against both resumed real TUIs, retaining their history and models. The user's
retry then showed “Codex server returned an error”. Relay evidence showed successful
resume plus unsupported configuration/model/queue/goal/bootstrap reads. The adapter
now provides read-only views of the live models and queued messages, unset
Codex-specific configuration, and the absence of Codex goals, collaboration presets,
and marketplace installations. Configuration and model responses pass pinned
upstream schema validation. The full metadata/resume sequence passes against both
real TUIs, including actual process output/exit delivery (19 ms Luna, 14 ms Astra).
Robin subsequently confirmed both Alpha and Beta typed round trips on the iPhone. The next relay
retry confirmed successful metadata reads, isolating the remaining
errors to the phone's non-PTY Git-status process requests. `process/spawn`, stdin,
kill, output, and exit notifications now use native xcsh host processes with a
live-terminal working directory, client-scoped handles, replay suppression, timeouts,
16 active-process limit, and bounded capture. PTY operations remain explicit errors.
Disconnected clients lose their standalone processes, while TUI agents continue.
One fixture restart selected a local model through the existing CLI resume path;
Alpha was relaunched with its original explicit Luna model and the same session ID.
Automatic model fidelity across CLI resume remains a lifecycle acceptance item.
Sanitized process-shape diagnostics identify known operation families without
logging commands. A further phone retry passed process startup and reached `turn/start`, which
rejected the phone's client message ID and turn settings. Turn submission now
accepts matching model/cwd, applies supported effort through AgentSession, handles
reasoning presentation preferences, and deduplicates client message IDs across
request IDs. Empty extra skill-root setup is accepted; nonempty roots remain
explicit errors. The phone-shaped typed turn passed against Luna (3551 ms) and
Astra (3352 ms), with duplicate client-message submissions suppressed. The user
reported that Alpha accepted the prompt, transitioned to thinking, and replied
`ALPHA-ORCHARD`. This establishes the first manual typed interoperability gate.
Robin then reported Beta accepted a prompt without thinking or replying. Its
selected Astra model rejected reasoning effort `none`. Provider discovery already
advertised the valid effort enum, but generated model policies overwrote it with
inferred capabilities. Discovered subscription thinking metadata is now preserved
through registry refresh and cache load, and remote model listing exposes it.
Provider errors now produce failed turns with a sanitized message instead of a
silent completed turn. Regression tests cover Astra, Sol, Terra, and Luna.
Observed red: five failures; green: 88 tests / 288 assertions, plus 102 registry
tests / 854 assertions and the coding-agent TypeScript check. Live retries returned
Alpha's marker in 3829 ms and Beta's in 3323 ms without duplicate prompts.
Robin subsequently confirmed “beta worked”. Both manual typed routing checks now
pass. All native voice checks remain pending; automated checks do not substitute
for iPhone observations. Actual phone bootstrap sends four extra skill roots;
nonempty root registration remains an explicit unsupported operation.

Product labels and host names use lowercase `xcsh`. Existing `XCSH_` environment
variable names retain their uppercase prefix.

## Work still required

1. Pairing and both Alpha/Beta typed round trips are confirmed by Robin.
   Complete the native voice gate.
2. Complete history pagination and all live turn/tool event mappings, terminal
   versus remote interaction ownership, and durable retry identities.
3. Implement native realtime transports, existing-call attachment, transcript
   provenance, exactly-once delegation, context updates, interruption, and shutdown.
4. Complete lifecycle coverage (rename/fork/resume/exit/restart), permission-state
   fidelity, and cancellation/error status reporting.
5. Add client listing/revocation, full auth recovery/retry-after handling, and
   exhaustive relay reconnect/buffering tests.
6. Verify packaged independence, live tasks on all four work models, and every
   iPhone acceptance checkpoint. Finish required CI/review/merge and cleanup.

Do not advertise voice support or successful phone acceptance until those gates
pass. Unsupported operations currently return protocol errors. Remote access is
off unless explicitly enabled; a running host exposes upgraded top-level TUIs.

## Development commands

From the feature worktree:

```sh
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts remote-control enable --json
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts remote-control status --json
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts remote-control pair
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts remote-control disable
bun packages/coding-agent/scripts/native-remote-session-gate.ts --run
bun test packages/coding-agent/test/remote-control
bun run check:ts
bun run --cwd packages/coding-agent test
```

Pairing output is an intentional credential delivery surface. Never copy it into
issues, PRs, fixtures, logs, or this file. The daemon's diagnostics contain method
names, parameter names, numeric error codes, and timestamps; response bodies, session text, tokens, and raw audio
are excluded. Enrollment/host state and credentials live in the user's xcsh
remote directory with private directory/file permissions.
